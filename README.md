#  conclusion and Summary
Python is a rich, versatile language with lots of prolific contributors. So where to start?

For reference, below are some Python tutorials that cover a range of Python libraries. We won't spend too much time today on basic syntax, etc., since that's well covered elsewhere and kinda boring. As a Python newbie, I've found that using Pandas/GeoPandas and NumPy have introduced me organically to other libraries, and have allowed me to see results quickly for basic geospatial tasks--so we'll start there!

Python basics: How to create lists, dictionaries, iterators, etc.
Python Markdown and LaTex: Documentation and formatting
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Pandas: Data wrangling and preparation using two types of data objects: 1) DataFrames, 2) Series.
GeoPandas: Basically the geospatial version of Pandas. Adds geospatial functionality to the DataFrame (Geo + DataFrame = GeoDataFrame).
NumPy: Multi-dimensional data arrays for manipulating large datasets. There are some functions for linear algebra and statistics within NumPy but it's also used by SciPy, matplotlib, and pandas for scientific computing.
SciPy: Scientific computing and statistical analysis. Uses NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and is common in earth sciences, astronomy, and oceanography.
Shapely: Spatial data model for planar features (points, curves, and surfaces).
Skikit-learn: regression, clustering, and classification algorithms
Various cool tricks
